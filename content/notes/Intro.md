## Basics
Lee asked me this morning whether I would be interested in helping Wilder play the piano.

I was thinking as I was driving to Shelley's, what would a simple but comprehensive introduction to music need to cover for learning to play the piano.

### The main elements of 'music'
What makes a song?
- Melody. The tune, illustrated by notes in a sequence.
- Rhythm. The timing used to play the notes.
- Tempo. The speed at which the notes are played.
- Harmony. The relationship between the notes, and between notes that are played together.
- Key.  Where in the musical scale the tune is played.
- Feeling. The emotion generated by all the above brought together.
- Lyrics. Sung with the music, the feeling in the music expressed in words.

### Hallelujah
Thinking of a song that would be good to start with, which can illustrate all the above and yet be reasonably simple and of interest to someone like Wilder. Len Cohen's Hallelujah, which appears in Trek, seemed a good candidate.
In Lily's music there is FÃ¼r Elise, which is in C, with a lot of interpretations on SoundCloud.

### Music
Centred around middle C
